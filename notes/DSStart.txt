each windows application's data segment has to start with an 16 byte structure (based off 3.1 kernel source code and symbols):

- the stack pointer on entry (!)
- stack segment on entry (!...to restore windows stack i guess???)
- pointer to the local application heap
- pointer to the atom table (string cache so you don't have to load from disk)
- pointer to the top of the stack (kernel: gmove_stack_top)
- "stackmin" and "stackbot" (kernel: same, not sure hwat the difference is)

then a stack signature
the idea is if it gets corrupted you can kill the application
without the damage getting worse
